> Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

* Crypto wars (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWwaVe1RF0c&t=2s)
* Bitcoin
* Stuxnet
* I like the DAO hack story as a cautionary tale about crypto not bring sufficient by itself. More thinking needed.

The following stories are endlessly repeated elsewhere, so I am tempted to omit them:

1. Enigma
2. Code talkers
3. Early computer hackers
