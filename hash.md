**Expalin hash functions.**

Now, this is hard. But here are some thoughts:

* Ignore non-cryptographic hash functions. While superficially similar, they have different use cases and would only cause confusion.
* Hash as a fingerprint, see Cinderella story by Dominic Tarr: http://dominictarr.com/post/154769946347/fairly-tale-cryptography-2-hashes
* One option would be to start with promises. It's an easy to understand use case. Naturally branches off the time traveller tale.
* Also, look at tallies.
