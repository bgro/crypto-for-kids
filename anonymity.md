A farmer or young lad captures a leprechaun and forces him to reveal the location of his buried treasure. The leprechaun assures him that the treasure is buried in an open field beneath a particular ragwort
plant. The farmer ties a red ribbon to the plant, first extracting promise from the leprechaun not to remove the ribbon. Releasing the leprechaun, he leaves to get a shovel. Upon his return he finds that
every weed in the field has been tied with an identical red ribbon, thus making it impossible to find the treasure.
